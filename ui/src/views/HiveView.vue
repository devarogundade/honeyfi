                    In the Hive of Golden Trade
                    <br> <br>
                    In the hive where bees do dwell,
                    They buzz and hum, their stories tell.
                    With wings of light, they search and roam,
                    Bringing nectar sweet back home.
                    <br> <br>
                    Each bee a worker, swift and true,
                    Building riches as they flew.
                    From flower to flower, they glean and dive,
                    Just like swaps within the hive.
                    <br> <br>
                    The honey pot, a treasure bright,
                    Is earned with every soaring flight.
                    For testnet users, bees of gold,
                    Rewards await for swaps untold.
                    <br> <br>
                    The hive’s a network, vast and wide,
                    With pathways clear and honey to guide.
                    Each token earned, a golden gleam,
                    A swap’s sweet nectar, a dream redeemed.
                    <br> <br>
                    So buzz, dear bee, and do your trade,
                    In HoneyFi’s hive, the work is laid.
                    For those who swap with care and glee,
                    The sweetest rewards are theirs to see.
